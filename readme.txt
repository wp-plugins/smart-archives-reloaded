An elegant and easy way to present your archives.

== Description ==

Smart Archives Reloaded is an enhanced version of the [Smart Archives](http://justinblanton.com/projects/smartarchives/) plugin by Justin Blanton.

Why is this plugin better?

* **Easy setup** - no code editing required
* **Better caching** - no need to wait when publishing a new post
* **Settings page** - elegantly choose how you want the archives displayed

See a live [example](http://scribu.net/arhiva) on my site.

== Installation ==

The plugin can be installed in 3 easy steps:

1. Unzip "Custom Field Images" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.
1. Insert `[smart_archives]` in a page or post.

Alternatively, you can add `<?php do_action('smart_archives'); ?>` anywhere in your theme, where you want the archives displayed.
