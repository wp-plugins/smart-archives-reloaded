Smart Archives Reloaded is an enhanced version of the [Smart Archives](http://justinblanton.com/projects/smartarchives/) plugin by Justin Blanton.

Why is this plugin better?

* **Better caching** - no need to wait when publishing a new post
* **Settings page** - elegantly choose how you want the archives displayed

See a live [example](http://scribu.net/arhiva) on my site.

The plugin can be installed in 3 easy steps:

1. Unzip "Smart Archives Reloaded" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).

Alternatively, you can add `<?php smart_archives(); ?>` anywhere in your theme, where you want the archives displayed.
